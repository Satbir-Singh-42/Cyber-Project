```bash
# Check if Node.js is installed
node --version

# If not, download from https://nodejs.org/
```

#### Problem: "Port 5000 already in use"
**Solution:** Another app is using port 5000
```bash
# Option 1: Stop the other app
# Option 2: Change port in server/index.ts
# Or kill the process using the port (Advanced)
```

#### Problem: "Cannot connect to localhost:5000"
**Solution:** 
1. Make sure `npm run dev` is running
2. Check for errors in the terminal
3. Try restarting the application
4. Try a different browser

#### Problem: Port scanner shows no results
**Solution:**
- Check your internet connection
- Try scanning `scanme.nmap.org` (test site)
- Firewall might be blocking connections
- Some networks block port scanning

#### Problem: Keylogger detector shows many false positives
**Solution:** This is normal - many legitimate processes contain keywords like "monitor" or "capture". Always research processes before taking action.

#### Problem: File integrity monitor fails
**Solution:**
- Check that the directory path exists
- Ensure you have read permissions
- Don't use special characters in paths
- On Windows, use forward slashes: `C:/Users/Name` or escape backslashes: `C:\\Users\\Name`
