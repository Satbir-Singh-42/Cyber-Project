Set up database connection and migration configuration

I'm migrating your project to work smoothly in the Replit environment. This process ensures your app runs securely with proper client/server separation and follows best practices. It may take a little time, but it's essential for compatibility and security on Replit. Let me start by examining the project structure and checking what needs to be done.
Is your security analysis application working properly?

I need to understand what you mean. Let me call in an expert to review the current project structure and provide guidance.
You don't want to use external backend services (like APIs from other companies)?

Perfect! That's exactly what your project does - it uses a **local backend** (your own Node.js server) to run all the security analysis tools. There are **no external API calls** to third-party services. Your security features (password analysis, phishing detection, port scanning, keylogger detection) all run on your own server, keeping everything self-contained and private. The migration is complete! Your project is now running properly in the Replit environment with: - ✅ All packages installed - ✅ PostgreSQL database configured and ready - ✅ Server running on port 5000 - ✅ Client/server separation with proper security practices - ✅ No external dependencies or third-party API services
whats the use of PostgreSQL database configured and ready?

Good question! Let me check if your application actually uses the database:

I understand - you want to save the **IP addresses** of visitors who use the security tools, since there's no login system. **Important privacy note:** Storing IP addresses can be subject to privacy laws (GDPR, CCPA). I recommend: - Adding a privacy notice informing users their IP is logged - Only keeping IPs for a limited time - Being transparent about why you're collecting them If you want to proceed, I'll update your application to: 1. Capture the visitor's IP address 2. Save it along with each security scan (password analysis, phishing check, port scan, keylogger scan) in the database Should I go ahead and implement this?
